## Overview

During my time at Moz I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to develop a game again. We had a 3ish-month deadline so some of the code here may have a little bit of a rushed look to it in places although I tried to avoid that as much as possible. I had worked on a large majority of the code but I cannot claim ownership of the assets. My goal was to create a highly customizeable game maing use of the Unity Editor for various gameplay tweaks and avoiding code changes where possible. This was originally written in Unity 5.2 so it is likely using deprecated methods. This version was last opened in Unity 2017.3.1f1 So you'll need a similar version to ensure the correct hashes.

## Basic Design

Roger Patrol is a top-down space shooter similar to asteroids. It utilizes "tank" controls in which forward or backwards is thrust in the direction you are facing. This was to make the game have a little bit of a learning curve. The goal was to have most players on average only survive for about 90 seconds. This is achieved with scaling difficulty as your score progresses. We also wanted to encourage movement as you'll notice score only ticks up as you are moving but you build up a multiplier based on the number of defeated enemies.
